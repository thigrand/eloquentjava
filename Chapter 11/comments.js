The way we have defined fun allows functions in Egg to “close over” the surrounding environment, allowing the function’s body to use local values that were visible at the time the function was defined, just like JavaScript functions do.

The following program illustrates this: function f returns a function that adds its argument to f's argument, meaning that it needs access to the local scope inside f to be able to use variable a.

run("do(define(f, fun(a, fun(b, +(a, b)))),",
    "   print(f(4)(5)))");
// → 9

Go back to the definition of the fun form and explain which mechanism causes this to work.
