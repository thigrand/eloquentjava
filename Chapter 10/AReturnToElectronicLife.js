/* Hoping that Chapter 7 is still somewhat fresh in your mind, think back to the system designed in that chapter and come up with 
a way to separate the code into modules. To refresh your memory, these are the functions and types defined in that chapter, 
in order of appearance:

Vector
Grid
directions
directionNames
randomElement
BouncingCritter
elementFromChar
World
charFromElement
Wall
View
WallFollower
dirPlus
LifelikeWorld
Plant
PlantEater 
SmartPlantEater
Tiger

Don’t exaggerate and create too many modules. A book that starts a new chapter for every page would probably get on your nerves, 
if only because of all the space wasted on titles. Similarly, having to open ten files to read a tiny project isn’t helpful. 
Aim for three to five modules.

You can choose to have some functions become internal to their module and thus inaccessible to other modules.

There is no single correct solution here. Module organization is largely a matter of taste.
