/*
A tricky subject in dependency management is circular dependencies, where module A depends on B, and B also depends on A. 
Many module systems simply forbid this. CommonJS modules allow a limited form: 
it works as long as the modules do not replace their default exports object with another value and start accessing each 
other’s interface only after they finish loading.

Can you think of a way in which support for this feature could be implemented? Look back to the definition of require and 
consider what the function would have to do to allow this.
